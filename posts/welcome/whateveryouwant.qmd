## Problem Description

Bob Ross, the iconic host of The Joy of Painting, is renowned for his ability to paint tranquil and attractive landscapes in under 30 minutes. This paper examines the colors used in his paintings to determine color usage trends, with a special emphasis on the most and least often used colors. By evaluating these elements, we obtain insight into Ross' artistic tastes and the color palettes that constitute his distinct style.

The goal of this analysis is to investigate the color palette used by Bob Ross in his television series *The Joy of Painting*. By examining the frequency and combination of colors used, we aim to uncover insights into his artistic style, which helped define the serene and picturesque landscapes he painted.

## Dataset Overview

```{r}
#| label: tbl-chart1
data_description <- data.frame(
  Feature = c("Title", 
              "Season and Episode", 
              "Image Source", 
              "Color Information", 
              "Usage Frequency"),
  Description = c("The name of each painting.",
                  "The season and episode number in which the painting was featured.",
                  "Links to the images of the paintings.",
                  "Binary indicators for the presence (True/False) of 22 specific colors across the paintings, including Titanium White, Alizarin Crimson, Van Dyke Brown, etc.",
                  "Reflects the color palettes Bob Ross employed, offering insights into his artistic choices and recurring themes.")
)

# Generate the customized table for a dark theme
kable(data_description, caption = "Key Features of the Dataset") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), 
                full_width = F, 
                position = "center") %>%
  row_spec(0, background = "#333333", color = "#FFFFFF", bold = TRUE) %>%  # Header row dark background
  row_spec(1:nrow(data_description), background = "#444444", color = "#FFFFFF") %>%  # Data rows
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)  # Bold the first column
```

## Analysis
```{r plot 1}
#| label: fig-fig1
#| echo: false
# Separate the most and least used colors
most_used_colors <- color_usage_long %>% arrange(desc(Count)) %>% head(5)
least_used_colors <- color_usage_long %>% arrange(Count) %>% head(5)

# Plot the most used colors
plot1 <- ggplot(most_used_colors, aes(x = reorder(Color, Count), y = Count)) +
  geom_col(fill = "cyan4") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Most Used Colors in Bob Ross Paintings",
       x = "Color",
       y = "Usage Count") 
plot1 + dark_theme_bw()
```

-   The @fig-fig1 visually represents the five most frequently used colors in Bob Ross's paintings. The bar chart @fig-fig1 displays the usage count of each color, highlighting **Titanium White** as the most dominant color, followed by **Alizarin Crimson**, **Van Dyke Brown**, **Cadmium Yellow**, and **Yellow Ochre**. These colors are crucial elements in Rossâ€™s palette, often forming the foundation of his natural landscapes, such as skies, mountains, and foliage.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-fig2
color_columns <- colnames(bob_ross)[grepl("Black_Gesso|Bright_Red|Burnt_Umber|Cadmium_Yellow|Dark_Sienna|Indian_Red|Indian_Yellow|Liquid_Black|Liquid_Clear|Midnight_Black|Phthalo_Blue|Phthalo_Green|Prussian_Blue|Sap_Green|Titanium_White|Van_Dyke_Brown|Yellow_Ochre|Alizarin_Crimson", colnames(bob_ross))]

# Subset the color columns and create a color co-occurrence matrix
color_matrix <- bob_ross[, color_columns]
color_cooccurrence <- as.matrix(t(color_matrix)) %*% as.matrix(color_matrix)

# Convert to a long format for plotting
melted_cooccurrence <- melt(color_cooccurrence)

# Plot the heatmap using ggplot2
plot3 <- ggplot(melted_cooccurrence, aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Color Co-occurrence in Bob Ross Paintings", x = "Colors", y = "Colors") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1, size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 12),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10))
plot3 + dark_theme_grey()
```

- The heatmap @fig-fig2 highlights common color pairings in Bob Ross's paintings, with darker shades representing higher co-occurrence. It reveals his consistent use of base colors like Titanium White and frequent pairings of natural tones, reflecting his signature landscape style.

## Conclusion

The research of color usage in Bob Ross's paintings reveals a strong preference for specific colors, the most commonly used being Titanium White and Alizarin Crimson. These findings are congruent with Ross's technique, which seeks to produce vivid but relaxing nature images. The least used hues, while less noticeable, helped to create unique features in individual artworks. This analysis of color utilization sheds light on the artistic decisions that shaped Bob Ross' renowned landscapes.
