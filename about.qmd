Hi, I'm Aditya Rao, a master's student at Monash University pursuing a degree in Business Analytics. After gaining experience in marketing, I decided to switch streams, as I found the field of analytics to be a promising option for my career. 

I am passionate about leveraging data to drive insights, and I aim to work in marketing analytics or consulting in the future. My technical skills include proficiency in R, Python, and Java, which I use to analyze and solve complex business problems. 

I am also a part-time badminton coach and enjoy playing badminton in my free time. I am a voracious reader and often find myself reading absurdist philosophies as a genre of choice. Some of my other hobbies include photography, travel and gaming.
